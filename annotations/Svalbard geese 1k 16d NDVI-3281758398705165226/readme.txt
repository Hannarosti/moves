This annotated dataset comes from the Environmental Data Automated Track Annotation System (Env-DATA) on Movebank (movebank.org). The environmental data attributes are created and distributed by government and research organizations. For general information on the Env-DATA System, see Dodge et al. (2013) and movebank.org/node/6607.

Terms of use for animal movement data in Movebank are defined by the study owners in the License Terms for the study. Terms of use for environmental datasets vary by provider; see below for details. When using these results in presentations or publications, acknowledge the use of Env-DATA and Movebank and cite Dodge et al. (2013).

File attributes

Attributes from the Movebank database (see the Movebank Attribute Dictionary at http://www.movebank.org/node/2381):
Location Lat: latitude in decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system
Location Long: longitude in decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system
Timestamp: the time of the animal location estimates, in UTC
Height Raw
Comments
Algorithm Marked Outlier
Update Ts

Locations are the the geographic coordinates of locations along an animal track as estimated by the processed sensor data.

Attributes from annotated environmental data:
Name: MODIS Land Vegetation Indices 1km 16d Aqua NDVI
Description: The normalized difference vegetation index: a measure of the concentration of live plant leaves based on remote sensing reflectance measurements. Higher values indicate more vegetation. Estimate is based on the highest quality image for each pixel obtained during each 16-day period (criteria used are low clouds, low view angle and highest NDVI/EVI value).
Unit: unitless (NDVI)
No data values: -3 (provider), NaN (interpolated)
Interpolation: inverse-distance-weighted
